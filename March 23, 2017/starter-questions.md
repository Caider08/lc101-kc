# Starter Questions

All questions can have more answers that what is listed here.

## CSharp

* What are some possible downsides to dictionaries?
  * Not very flexible all the time e.g. only allow key/value
  * Cannot have duplicate keys within a dictionary -- causes problems when that should be allowed
* What is special about `PoCo`?
  * Nothing!  :-)
  * It stands for "Plain Old C# Object"
* What is `Linq`?
  * A fancy way of accessing data in collections
  * A handy way to get data out of collections
  * Language Integrated Query
  * Mostly it allows for a familiar syntax to access data regardless of how it is backed (e.g. by classes that could call a database or memory or something else entirely)
* What is model binding?
  * It's what allows you to bind data directly in your parameters on your controller actions
  * We've been using it from the start with our controller methods
  * It also allows for more complex object creation in our methods
* What is the default order of model binding?
  * From Values -> Route Values (URL PATH) -> Query Parameters (the stuff after the ? in the URL)

## General

* How was the TechJobs MVC?
* Feedback for any of the class?
* Will moving locations be okay? We have to move... so hopefully that's a yes.
